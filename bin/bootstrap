# This is a script for your user account that installs and configures essential
# (but user-specific) software packages that cannot be installed or configured
# with self-install scripts.  It is idempotent, so it can be safely run multiple
# times.  Because they are idempotent, this script will also run both
# bootstrap-system and bootstrap-dotfiles, but they should still be run manually
# before running it.
